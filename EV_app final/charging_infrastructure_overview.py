    ## **Chart 1: Fuel Stations vs. EV Charging Points**  
    - **Fuel stations continue to outnumber EV charging points** across Germany.  
    - **Infrastructure density** is notably higher in **South** and **West Germany**, where the network of charging stations is more developed.  
    - **Northeast Germany** has a **significant gap** in both fuel and EV charging infrastructure.  
    - **Berlin** stands out with a **relatively high density of charging points**, reflecting its role as a key EV hub.  
    - **Key Insight:** Germanyâ€™s EV charging infrastructure still has a **long way to go** to catch up with the more established fuel station network.

    ### **Key Takeaways:**  
    - Germany's **EV charging infrastructure** is growing but still lags behind the fuel station network.  
    - The **Southern and Western regions** are better served, while **Northeast Germany** and smaller towns need more investment.  
    - **Berlin** is leading the charge, both in terms of the number of charging points and planned infrastructure investments by **2030**.
